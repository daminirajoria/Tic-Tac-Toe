# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game Overview:
HTML: The game structure is defined using HTML, which creates a grid layout for the Tic-Tac-Toe board. The board typically consists of a 3x3 grid, with each cell represented by a clickable element (like a div or button).

CSS: Styling is applied through CSS to make the game visually appealing. This includes setting the dimensions of the cells, adding borders, and applying colors to differentiate between player moves (X and O). Responsive design can be implemented to ensure the game looks good on various screen sizes.

JavaScript: The game logic is handled by JavaScript. It manages player turns, checks for win conditions (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and handles ties. When a player clicks a cell, JavaScript updates the board, checks for a winner, and allows players to reset the game once it's over.

Key Features
Interactive UI: Players can click on cells to make their moves.
Player Turn Management: Alternates turns between Player X and Player O.
Win Detection: Checks for winning combinations after each move.
Restart Option: Allows players to start a new game after one finishes.

This simple implementation provides a fun and interactive way for users to enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe in their web browsers. You can further enhance the game by adding features like score tracking, AI opponents, or different difficulty levels!
